Description: A package management library for RISC OS
 LibPkg includes libraries for:
 - representing version numbers, status records and control files;
 - accessing the content of package files; and
 - installing and removing packages.
 .
 The first use of LibPkg will be as the back-end of PackMan,
 but it is not tied to any particular user interface and there could
 be other front-ends in the future.  Parts of LibPkg are likely to be
 useful for writing package development tools and other types of
 package management utility.
